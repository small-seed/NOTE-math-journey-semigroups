# Biological Algorithms Concept

This section presents a few working hypotheses and speculative thoughts that have emerged while exploring the idea of “biological algorithms”.At this stage, the concepts of biological algorithms and biological programming are still informal and far from rigorously defined — living systems are extremely complicated, and we do not yet have a clean mathematical framework for them. Therefore, everything written below should be taken as exploratory speculation rather than established theory.One consequence of this viewpoint is that it naturally leads to some scepticism about how accurately biological cognitive systems (including human perception) represent objective reality. Different organisms clearly solve the same sensory problem in very different ways (the octopus colour-vision example on the next page is a nice illustration), which suggests that our own perception is just one possible processing strategy among many, not necessarily the “true” one.The core intuition I am playing with is fairly simple: cells appear to contain conditionally reactive molecular networks that execute programmed state transitions in response to inputs. These conditional reactions seem to be chained together across multiple scales — from single molecules inside one cell, through networks of cells, all the way to whole tissues and organisms — and the end result is what we recognise as adaptive or even intelligent behaviour. Whether this picture will turn out to be useful remains an open question, but it is the starting point for the notes and papers collected here.
