# Biological Algorithms Concept

Doubts about the accuracy of current cognitive models arise from the concept of **biological algorithms**, which propose that cells operate through conditionally reactive molecular systems capable of executing programmed operations. This algorithmic process extends continuously from the molecular scale to multicellular organization, ultimately producing observable behaviors.

The underlying principles are described in the following documents:
